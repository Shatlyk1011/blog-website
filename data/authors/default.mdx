Hi, I’m Shatlyk, a freelance web developer and designer crafting scalable, user-focused web applications. I specialize in building modern, responsive solutions using best practices.

Previously worked as a led frontend teams on large-scale projects, driving both performance enhancements and top-tier SEO results. Managed the entire development cycle—from initial concept and architecture through deployment and optimization.

I believe quality code is the foundation of great products. My workflow is guided by best practices, code review, and staying up-to-date with the latest tools.

I bring digital products to life with thoughtful UI/UX, creative animations, and attention to detail using Figma, GSAP, and Framer Motion. Explore my projects on my [projects page](/projects)

I’m open to freelance or collaborative projects. If you’re looking for someone passionate about both design and development <a href="https://shatlykabdullayev.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let’s connect</a> !
